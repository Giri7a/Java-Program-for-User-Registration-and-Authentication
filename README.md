# Java-Program-for-User-Registration-and-Authentication

Description:
This Java program, named "Instaa," is designed for user registration and authentication. It offers the following features:
* Sign Up: Users can create an account by providing a username, password, Gmail address, and Gmail password. After successful registration, the program confirms the 
   registration.
* Log In: Registered users can log in using their username and password. The program allows a limited number of login attempts, and it provides feedback on the number of 
   remaining attempts.
* Reset Username: Registered users can reset their username by confirming their Gmail address and password. The program sends a one-time password (OTP) to the Gmail address 
   for verification.
* Reset Password: Registered users can reset their password using a similar process as resetting the username, including OTP verification.
* Log Out: Logged-in users can log out of their accounts.
* Exit: Users can exit the program.

The code uses a console-based interface and includes features like OTP generation, user data storage, and user-friendly prompts for user interactions.
